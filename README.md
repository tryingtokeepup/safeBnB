# safeBnB

Previous iteration has a completely broken production but working dev environment. Going to use this repo to compare and break down where the two are conflicting.

## Finish Line:

Getting this done by the end of Feburary. Going to go with default stack, will try to add Oauth and cookies to round out auth strategy after sessions MVP. Want to move on to my major project; will use this code as a testing ground.

## Add in documentation + technology stack

React + Next.js (technology I've wanted to play around with for a while) with Passport.js and simple Postgres backend. No Go or AWS this go around (stretch for future?)

## Add in possible additions beyond tutorial content

Adding in postgressql database; will attempt to use the Postico app.

## Practice teaching React concepts to others
